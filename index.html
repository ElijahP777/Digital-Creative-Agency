            <p> Designers and creative people use nature is an infinite source of ideas for their inventions and
                products.
                Everyday, we interact with products whose shape or principle function is inspired by the world around
                us,
                from swim suits inspired by fish to laptops closing like clams. In the interview below, the Institute of
                Biomimicry answers our questions, shedding the light on how following nature’s example can lead to
                innovation and success. As human populations urbanise, there is an increasing movement to facilitate the
                connection and appreciation humans intrinsically have for the natural world. Together with the fact that
                science continues to develop new means of understanding how nature works from the micro to macro levels,
                biomimics are developing greater dexterity in mimicking the principles behind nature’s strategies. Take
                3D-printing for example, this emerging technology not only opens the door to local manufacturing,
                reducing
                long-distance transport of goods, it could also allow the production of high-performing, compostable
                materials for everything from textiles and packaging to medical devices and electronics. </p>

                Traditional design is calm, orderly, and predictable. When you think about traditionally-styled
                interiors,
                think of comforting styles and classic designs. Your family home growing up might have even been styled
                in
                traditional furnishings. Traditional homes are somewhat casual, with every piece going together. It’s
                all
                about function and ease. Modern design is one of the most misinterpreted styles in interior design, with
                people often using it when defining contemporary design. The popular modern designs of today feature
                heavy
                textures, ornamentation, and contrasting elements. One defining component of modern design is its
                minimalistic touch. Modern designs heavily rely on a lack of fussiness. </p>

                Understanding white color meanings provides an interior decorator with a color tool kit. In fact
                understanding all the color meanings fills this tool kit and gives you an advantage over the
                competition.
                You can select colors with a full understanding of what they mean and how they evoke feelings and this
                is
                critical for creating harmonious interior spaces.White is not really a color, it is a neutral, but we
                will
                call it a color for ease of reading. If you read about Sir Issac Newton and how he discovered the color
                of
                light you will then get a good understanding of color and how we see it.White light actually contains
                all
                the colors within it, we just can’t see them as they are being reflected. The neutral “colors” range
                from
                white, through the grays to black.
                White is the most commonly used color in interior design, especially in areas where bathing, cleaning
                and
                food preparation are prevalent.

            <div class="title">Number of students studying design and technology subjects goes up for first time in

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body-news">
            <p>The number of students studying design and technology subjects is on the rise for the first time since
                2010, according to data released today by Ofqual.There were some 9,620 students registered for the
                design and technology A-Level in 2022 compared to 8,345 in 2021, which is a 15.3% increase. Design is
                split into two pathways at A-Level: art and design, and design and technology. <br> &ensp;Art and design
                is still the most popular A-Level strand this year with 41,735 students, compared to design and
                technology’s 9,620 students. Both strands have seen an increase in students studying on their
                courses.Collectively, there were 51,355 students studying on both strands, which is a 7.8% increase from
                last year. <br>&ensp; However, it is important to recognise that while the number of students taking art
                and design subjects has fluctuated over the last decade, there has been a clear decline in the number of
                students taking design and technology subjects. This is likely to be linked to successive governments
                prioritising STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths), over arts subjects. <br>
                &ensp;The ripples of this are still being felt across the education system.The average number of
                students studying on the art and design A-level strand over the past five years sits at 39,803, while
                the average for design and technology during the same period is 9,213.</p>

        <div class="modal-body-news">
            <p>Sam Jacob Studio was commissioned to redesign the entrance lobby, information desk, and WCs at V&A.
                Taking inspiration from the museum’s glass collection four floors above the entrance, the studio created
                the new entrance lobby with three bands of glass tubes, which shorten in diameter for the mid and upper
                levels. <br>&ensp;Designed to transmit light, the entrance is meant to produce optical distortions as
                people pass through it, accentuating their movements. It also serves to project daylight into the
                museum. <br>&ensp; Taking cue from the entrance lobby, the welcome desk in the centre of the Dome is
                also features glass tubes backed by mirrored panels – a continuation of the optical illusion theme.
                According to Sam Jacob Studio, the design lends itself well to the livelier events in the lobby, when
                the desk can be converted into a bar. Meanwhile, coloured disco lights reflect through the glass.
                <br>&ensp; By repurposing 700kgs of blue, pink, black and grey ceramic waste from Wedgwood’s factory in
                Stoke, Sam Jacob Studio created terrazzo wall panels for the WCs. Scaled-up versions of figures from the
                museum’s ceramics selection have been digitally printed onto coloured tiles, which adorn the interior of
                each cubicle.

            <p>The private EVOTL (electric vertical take-off and landing) service is a high-end travel concept initially
                aimed at wealthy Chinese customers who travel between Chinese megacities for business and leisure. VW
                and Tangerine say that they targeted over one hundred individuals of this description across China for
                user research, which heavily influenced the design. <br>He says that a challenge of the brief was
                “making it look great and fit the luxury user requirements, while working within lots of different
                engineering requirements and limitations”. One consideration was coming up with “innovative ideas and
                methodologies to best define the experience of getting in and out of the aircraft using the EVTOL skate
                and door dimensions, and then maximation of the interior space to provide enough capacity to create a
                luxury interior,” she adds. <br> &ensp;Tangerine was chosen for the partnership because of its
                experience in commercial aircraft design and knowledge of passenger experience, according to He. “The
                exterior is just a taster of what’s to come and we look forward to showcasing the interior design and
                total customer experience in the near future,” she says.</p>

            <p>James Lunn: BBC Bitesize360 is an Oculus Quest 2 application whereby students use VR to explore their
                learning in an immersive and futuristic way. The application is targeted at both male and female
                audiences between the ages of 11-16. The interface is personalised throughout, ensuring the child is at
                the heart of the Bitesize experience, and so progression can be closely monitored through the parent
                portal included. The Bitesize360 application future-proofs BBC Bitesize using VR technology and ensures
                a more fun and memorable experience. <br>&ensp;JL: The most challenging aspect of the Bitesize360
                project was undoubtedly the research process. Having an age range of 11-16 year olds, this threw up a
                few obstacles that I needed to address. Firstly, crafting a questionnaire that is tailored and adequate
                for this age bracket, as well as receiving sufficient responses that varied in age and gender. This
                process undoubtedly encroached on my project development, but I knew this research was necessary to
                inform my design choices for the interface. <br>&ensp;JL: I am currently working in industry as a junior
                UX/UI designer, and hope to explore this area further as I start to gain knowledge and experience of
                this field. In five years’ time I hope to be a sufficient practitioner in UX/UI and continue working for
                a design agency as a mid-weight designer. <br> <br> You can find our guide to 2022 graduate design shows

            <p>The big focus this year will be the intersection of design and sustainability. The aim, the fair says, is
                to “demonstrate that it is both possible and crucial to start holding great international events live

                same.<br>&ensp;“We cannot stand still, in fact we have a duty to move even faster in the direction of
                design, production and distribution solutions that are as sustainabe as possible – what we need today is
                an ethical approach to design,” says President Maria Porro.<br>&ensp; The crown jewel this year is
                architect Mario Cucinella’s large installation Design with Nature, which explores the themes of circular
                economy, reuse and participatory architecture. The installation, made with materials derived from
                natural supply chains and from upcycled and recycled waste products, will span a 1,400 sq m space filled
